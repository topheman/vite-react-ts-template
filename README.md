  - Pre-commit hook to run linting, type checking and tests

## Getting started

### Customize the project

Run the following command, you will be prompted for the project name, description and package manager, it will update the proper files to match your choices.

```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server
- `npm run build`: Build the project
- `npm run preview`: Preview the project
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix`: Fix ESLint errors
- `npm run test`: Run tests
- `npm run test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run typecheck`: Run type checking

## Deploy

This template is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages when you push to the `master` branch, on the other branches, it will only lint/typecheck/test and build the project.

You can customize the deployment by editing the [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) file.

To enable the deployment to GitHub Pages, in your repository settings, go to "Pages" and switch to "GitHub Actions" as the source.
